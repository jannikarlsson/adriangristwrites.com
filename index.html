    <h2>Transplanted & exposed</h2>
    <p>'Transplanted' is a brutally candid – and at times (I hope) quirkily amusing – memoir that recounts a period of my life when a number of health issues spiralled out of control; ultimately that period ended with me requiring a double-organ transplant.</p>
    <p>Since that operation, I have had to live with a bunch of hidden, and not-so-hidden, disabilities. The book contains flashbacks and anecdotes to certain medical events with the aim to share a frank and unflinching portrayal of ill health, and the complications I – and millions like me – face on a day-to-day basis.</p>
    <p>These memories are recalled during the corona pandemic, which put the lives of the most vulnerable in our society into sharp focus. But this book is not about the pandemic per se, rather it is meant as a window on, and exploration of, a life being lived with hidden disabilities.</p>
    <p>Among the heart-wrenching, stomach churning and downright bizarre memories, there are tales of being on dialysis, being in a wheelchair, being in a coma, partially sightedness, having my genitals mutilated, and being awake while a surgeon fumbles around wrist-deep inside my innards.</p>
    <p>This book might be a bit piss-y, poo-y, icky, sicky, bile-y and bloody, but its intention isn't really to offend or make you feel uncomfortable, it's there to enlighten and entertain.</p>

        <p>Adrian looks healthy. Healthy enough, anyway. No one looks at him and quietly ponders with pity, How does he live like that? How does he sleep/eat/pee? And as someone with a number of disabilities and significant health issues, he is well aware of how very fortunate he is to be able to say that.</p>
        <p>But here are some things you cannot see: you cannot see that both his feet are acutely deformed, so much so he could probably borrow the Elephant Man's old shoes; you cannot see the transplant scars, so glaringly huge he can jovially pass them off as shark bites; you cannot see the bullet-like wounds where various tubes have been inserted into his guts for months on end. You cannot see the wheelchair that he dreads he will have to use again. Nope, you cannot see any of that, but then, he cannot see you either, at least he cannot see you very well, partial-sightedness puts pay to that.</p>
        <p>He is but one speck on the spectrum of disability, but a speck who is afforded both the luxury of time and inclination to share his story.</p>
        <p>During the convalescence period post-transplant surgery, Adrian left a comment on a music blog. Now, more than 12 years later, he has married the author of that blog and lives in Sweden where he works in research communication for a university.</p>
